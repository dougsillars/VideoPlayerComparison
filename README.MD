This repo is a test bed to evaluate different video streaming players on the web.

Initial tests will be based on free video players:

Video.js https://github.com/videojs/video.js
Hls.js https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js/
Plyr https://github.com/sampotts/plyr
MediaElement https://github.com/mediaelement/mediaelement
Viblast http://viblast.com/player/
New really small (from tweet) https://t7.github.io/web-components/media-player-element/

I may also look at paid players, as time (and finanaces) permit
